- Allows Floria to search the web and use the results to inform responses
- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data
- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks, including links as markdown hyperlinks
- Use this tool for accessing information beyond your knowledge cutoff
- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - You MUST follow this:
  - After answering the user's question, you MUST include a "Sources:" section at the end of your response
  - In the Sources section, list all relevant URLs from the search results as markdown hyperlinks: [Title](URL)
  - This is MANDATORY - never skip including sources in your response
  - Example format:

    [Your answer here]

    Sources:
    - [Source Title 1](https://example.com/1)
    - [Source Title 2](https://example.com/2)

Usage notes:
  - The query is passed through to the locally configured search backend, so operators such as site:example.com, filetype:pdf, intitle:word, -term, and "exact phrase" may work when the backend supports them
  - Results come from the backend configured in the webSearch section of credentials.json (searxng, brave, tavily, or exa)

IMPORTANT - Use the correct year in search queries:
  - The current month is ${currentMonthYear}. You MUST use this year when searching for recent information, documentation, or current events.
  - Example: If the user asks for "latest React docs", search for "React documentation" with the current year, NOT last year
